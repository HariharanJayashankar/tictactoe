# Tictactoe AI

This is a basic tictactoe AI. It uses the [minimax algorithm](https://www.educba.com/minimax-algorithm/).

It's a reinforcement learning algorithm which basically uses a standard discrete dynamic programming approach for n players.

I think it's impossible to win tictactoe against this AI!

To get this started all you need to do is this:

```julia
using tictactoe
playgame_ai()
```

You could also just play with yourself if you're having one of those days:

```julia
playgame()
```
